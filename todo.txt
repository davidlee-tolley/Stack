Ordered by importance:
[ ] Integrate Firebase to store/retrieve data
[ ] Implement priority ordering (set different ordering options too)
[ ] Make filters work (add filters, etc.)
[ ] Add "done" buttons to picker views
[ ] Widget (lock screen push notification?)
[ ] Siri integration (very specific wording to add/edit/remove a task?)
[ ] Drag and move tasks to reorder
[x] Implement something to make the slide-in menu more visible when it pops over tasks
